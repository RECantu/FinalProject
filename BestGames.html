                <p class="hidden-paragraph">Every since its inital release in Novemeber, this game never once disappointed me in any aspic of its function. The story is very interesting and there has been times where It has gotten me emotional, which tells me that the story writing was over the top. The gameplay is very unique comapred to many other gacha games out there. There is also mulitplayer mode called "Coordinated Operation" where you can play with your friends. Overall, I haven't seen much flaws to this game and from all this, this is the reason why I have this game ranked as one of, if not, the best games right now.</p>
